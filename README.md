# Practice-Problems

My name is Ankit Agrawal, and I am a student at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, VA, interested in studying Computer Science and Commerce. I have created this repository ("Practice-Problems") with the goal of storing my solutions for problems I tackle weekly from popular programming problem sites, such as LeetCode and HackerRank.

I plan to upload solutions weekly to problems I tackle, outlining my thought process and the steps I take to achieve an acceptable solution. I am open to comments and constructive criticism with my solutions--I know I have quite a lot to learn when it comes to developing software, and this GitHub repository can serve as a history of my growth and development in tackling various problems in the field.
