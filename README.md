# Practice-Problems

My name is Ankit Agrawal, and I am a student studying Computer Science and Commerce at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, VA. I have created this repository ("Practice-Problems") with the goal of storing my solutions for problems I tackle from popular programming problem sites, such as LeetCode and HackerRank.

For each problem I attempt, I plan to upload a link to the problem, the problem description from the corresponding link, and my solution. I sometimes also outline my thought process and the steps I took to achieve an acceptable solution. Throughout the process, I will be open to comments and constructive criticism with my solutions--I know I have quite a lot to learn when it comes to developing software, and this GitHub repository can serve as a history of my growth and development in tackling various problems in the field.
